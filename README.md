# Metatrader-A.I.-Bot-Trader
Aim to develop a Stock/FX/ETF/Futures prediction System using Python and TensorFlow with integration to the most widely used trading software (MetaTrader 5) which comes with free past data on different financial products. Aim is to integrate the A.I. to learn and predict the prices with at least 95% accuracy with the ability to open and close trades on "long" and "short" positions with the ability to set stop-loss, take-profits and trailing-stops.
